🌍 Demographic Analysis (2004 - 2024)

📌 Project Overview:
This project explores global demographic trends using life expectancy and under-5 mortality data from the International Database (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau. The dataset covers 227 countries, categorized by sex, region, and subregion, allowing for an in-depth analysis of health and population dynamics over a 20-year period (2004 - 2024).

🚀 Key Objectives:

✔️ Analyze frequency distributions of demographic indicators by sex and region.

✔️ Evaluate homogeneity vs. heterogeneity within and between subregions.

✔️ Examine bivariate correlations between demographic variables.

✔️ Compare historical changes in life expectancy and child mortality over two decades.

📊 Data Description

The dataset (census2004_2024.csv) contains:

🔹 Life Expectancy at Birth (overall, male, female)

🔹 Under-5 Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, overall, male, female)

🔹 227 Countries grouped into 5 regions and 21 subregions


Data sources: U.S. Census Bureau - IDB

🔍 Analytical Approach

✅ 1. Descriptive Statistics & Visualizations

Frequency distributions (histograms, mean, median)
Comparison across genders and regions

✅ 2. Regional Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity

Interquartile Range (IQR) Analysis within Europe
Box plots for visualizing demographic variation

✅ 3. Bivariate Correlation Analysis

Pearson correlation coefficient to assess relationships
Heatmaps for visual representation of associations

✅ 4. Temporal Comparison (2004 vs. 2024)

Change in life expectancy trends across time
Reduction in under-5 mortality rates

📈 Key Findings
📍 Life Expectancy Trends

✔️ Europe has the highest life expectancy, while Africa has the lowest.

✔️ Significant increase in life expectancy over 20 years, reflecting healthcare advancements.


📍 Under-5 Mortality Patterns

✔️ Africa shows the highest child mortality rates, while Europe has the lowest.

✔️ Marked global decline in under-5 mortality from 2004 to 2024.

📍 Correlation Insights

✔️ Strong negative correlation between life expectancy and under-5 mortality.

✔️ Higher life expectancy is associated with lower child mortality rates.

📍 Regional Variation

✔️ Northern & Southern Europe show homogeneous life expectancy.

✔️ Other European sub-regions display more variability.

🛠 Technologies Used

📊 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis & visualization

📈 Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

📝 Markdown & LaTeX for report documentation

📢 Conclusion

This project highlights significant improvements in global health over the past two decades, with increasing life expectancy and decreasing child mortality rates. However, disparities remain, particularly across Africa and Europe. Further research could explore socioeconomic & environmental factors affecting these trends.

🚀 Next Steps

🔹 Apply hypothesis testing for deeper statistical validation.

🔹 Investigate socioeconomic determinants of health disparities.

🔹 Expand the study to predict future trends (2025-2050).

📌 This project serves as a foundation for policymakers and researchers to better understand global demographic patterns.
